* INTRODUCTION

The Match(TM) tool is designed for searching potential binding sites for
transcription factors (TF binding sites) in any DNA sequence which may be 
of interest. Match(TM)  uses a library of mononucleotide weight matrices
from TRANSFAC(r). 
Match(TM) allows you to specify your search by using profiles. We use the 
term "profile" for a specific subset of weight matrices from the 
TRANSFAC(r) library with core similarity cut-off values and matrix 
similarity cut-off values for each matrix.

>From release to release, results obtained with Match(TM) can change, due 
to the addition of new matrices, matrix and profile updates, and improved 
cut-offs. Therefore, please always note the release / version number of 
TRANSFAC(r) Professional / Match(TM) which you used for your analysis. 
Although we advise to use always the latest release of TRANSFAC(r) 
Professional, in case you are doing a large analysis for which you want to 
assure that the conditions stay constant, it is advisable to do the whole 
analysis with one and the same locally installed version (same Match(TM) 
binary and same data files, i.e. same matrix.dat as well as same 
profiles).

Match(TM) is designed for binding site search in single sequences, i.e.
all sequences (from the submitted FASTA file) are analyzed individually.
Comparative analysis for overrepresented binding sites in a set of
sequences vs. a background set is provided in the ExPlain(TM)
Analysis System. For information on the ExPlain(TM) Analysis System,
please see the BIOBASE website: http://www.biobase-international.com/

**************************************************************************

* HOW TO USE MATCH(TM) FROM COMMAND LINE


Please note: Currently only the binding site search of Match(TM) can be
provided as command line tool. For accessory functionalities like creation
of user-defined profiles or matrices, please refer to the online version 
of Match(TM) or ExPlain(TM).

Command line use can be subject to change without notice.
For the full paramter list of your current version, please check
description on command line, when you type 'match' without parameters.

Currently the following Match(TM) command line versions are available
(see bin subdirectory in the match directory, after you downloaded
and extracted the TRANSFAC flat file download package):

match           (for Linux)
match_linux64   (for Linux 64)
match.exe       (for Windows)
match_irix      (for Irix)

**************************************************************************

* PROFILES (MATRIX SETS WITH CUT-OFFS)

We use the term "profile" for a specific subset of weight matrices from 
the TRANSFAC(r) library with core similarity cut-off values and matrix 
similarity cut-off values for each matrix.

Match(TM) will search only matrices that are specified in the profile.
It will return only hits with scores that are equal or higher than
the cut-offs specified in the profile.

Match(TM) offers a number of predefined profiles with cut-offs

- to minimize false negative matches:
match/data/minFN<VERSION>.prf (all TRANSFAC matrices)
match/data/minFN_good<VERSION>.prf (only high quality matrices)

- to minimize false positive matches: 
match/data/minFP<VERSION>.prf (all TRANSFAC matrices)
match/data/minFP_good<VERSION>.prf (only high quality matrices)

- to minimize the sum of both error rates:
match/data/minSUM<VERSION>.prf (all TRANSFAC matrices)
match/data/minSUM_good<VERSION>.prf (only high quality matrices)

In the directory match/data/prfs you will also find profiles for different
taxons (vertebrates, plants, fungi, insects, nematodes) and a number of
tissue and condition/process-specific profiles for vertebrates.
Cut-off in these profiles is minFN (to minimize number of false negatives).
To change the cut-off or the composition of a profile, please see below.



You can generate your own profiles with the help of the profile generation
tool in the web interface of the online version of Match(TM) in the following ways:

- Based on a matrix search result in TRANSFAC(r) (BKL) a profile can be
  created: Select the matrices in the database search result list to be
  included in the profile and then click on the "MATCH PROFILE" button 
  on top of the table to be redirected to the Profile Generation Tool
  in the Match(TM) interface, where the cut-offs for the profile can be defined.

- New profiles can be created in the Profile Generation Tool of the
  Match(TM) interface by selecting or searching from/in the listed matrices.

- Based on already existing profiles new ones can be created in the
  Match(TM) interface, by adding or removing matrices and/or by changing
  the cut-offs.
  
For details, please see the respective sections in the Match(TM) online
documentation.

To download in the Match(TM) interface a profile for command line use,
please click the "Download" button on top of the page after you generated
a new profile, or go to the Profile generation page, select one of your
previously saved profiles and then click on "Download".

- Profiles for command line use can also be created in and exported from
  the ExPlain(TM) Analysis System.

- Finally, new profiles can be created or existing ones modified with the
  help of a text editor. (For example, vertebrate profiles can be generated
  by removing with help of the search/replace function of your editor all
  those lines/matrices with identifiers other than "V$..."
  from the provided profiles minFP<VERSION>.prf, minSUM<VERSION>.prf, ...)



A profile should have the following format:

________________________________
TATA box and SP-1 sites
tata.prf
 MIN_LENGTH 300
0.0
1.000000 0.6 0.5 M00216 V$TATA_C

**************************************************************************

* CUT-OFFS 


Cut-offs are defined in the profile. Cut-offs can be changed with the help
of the Profile Generation Tool in the Match(TM) online version by
modification of an already existing profile and then saving it under a new
name. After it has been saved, the new profile can be exported via the
"Download" on top of the page.


Cut-offs for core and matrix similarity:

MSS (Matrix Similarity Score)
The matrix similarity is a score that describes the quality of a match
between a matrix and an arbitrary part of the input sequences. 

CSS (Core Similarity Score)
The core similarity score denotes the quality of a match between the core 
sequence of a matrix (i.e. the five consecutive most conserved positions 
within a matrix) and a part of the input sequence.

A match has to contain the "core sequence" of a matrix, i.e. the core 
sequence has to match with a score higher than or equal to the core 
similarity cut-off. In addition, only those matches which score higher 
than or equal to the matrix similarity threshold appear in the output.

For the minFP, minFN, and minSUM cut-offs, first the core similarity score 
is calculated, and then using this core similarity score the matrix 
similarity score is calculated. 


Precalculated cut-offs:

minFN (Cut-off to minimize false negative matches): 
The false negative rate was measured, as far as available, on known 
genomic binding sites for the transcription factors. In case not 
sufficient (less than 10) genomic binding sites were available, SELEX 
sites or sets of generated oligonucleotides were used for estimating the 
cut-offs to minimize the false negative rate, using actual weight matrices 
to calculate the probability of a nucleotide occurring at a certain 
position of a binding site. For each matrix we applied the Match(TM)  
algorithm to the test sequences without using any matrix similarity 
cut-offs. Then we set the cut-off to a value that provides recognition of 
at least 90% of oligonucleotides. We decided to tolerate an error rate of 
10%. We call this set of cut-offs minFN (=FN10) cut-offs.
Applying the minFN cut-offs, the user will find most genomic binding 
sites, but in this case a high rate of false positives should be taken 
into account as well. The minFN cut-offs are useful for the detailed 
analysis of relatively short DNA fragments. 

minFP (Cut-off to minimize false positive matches): 
In order to estimate this cut-off, which will reduce the number of random 
sites found by Match(TM), we applied the Match(TM) algorithm to promoter 
sequences from TRANSPRO. That score which gives 1% of hits in these 
sequences relative to the number of hits received when using the minFN 
score (calculated above) is defined as minFP.
When a minFP cut-off is applied for searching a DNA sequence, the 
algorithm will find a relatively low number of matches per nucleotide. In 
the output the user will only find putative sites with a good similarity 
to the weight matrix; however, some known genomic binding sites could not 
be recognized. This kind of cut-off is useful, for example, for searching 
the most promising potential binding sites in the extended genomic DNA 
sequences. 

minSUM (Cut-off to minimize the sum of both error rates): 
We compute a sum of both error rates to find cut-offs that give an optimal 
number of false positives and false negatives. To do so, we compute the 
number of matches found in promoter sequences for each matrix using a cut-
off allowing 10% of false negative matches (minFN=FN10). This number is 
defined as 100% of false positives. The sum of corresponding percentages 
for false positives and false negatives is then computed for every cut-off 
ranging from minFN10 to minFP. We refer to the cut-off that gives the 
minimum sum as minSum cut-off. 
  
FN10 (=minFN)
This cut-off allows a false negative rate of 10%.
For calculation, please see minFN above.
  
FN30:
This cut-off allows a false negative rate of 30%.
  
FN50:
This cut-off allows a false negative rate of 50%. 
  
FN70:
This cut-off allows a false negative rate of 70%.  
  
FN90:
This cut-off allows a false negative rate of 90%.   


Matrix "Quality": Matrices producing less than 10 hits (FP) per 1000 
nucleotides (in sequences, 10,000 to 5,000 nucleotides upstream of the 
transcription start sites) at minSUM are defined as "high quality 
matrices". About 5% of the current matrices producing higher FP rate, can 
be excluded as "highly abundant" / "low quality"; these 5% of matrices 
give about 50% of all FP hits.
  

The cut-offs and the quality (high/low) of a matrix is stored in the 
"index" file:

example line from the index file:
M00008|V$SP1_01|Sp1|T00759;T08484|0.819|0.957|0.819|0.851|0.819|0.914|high|0|0.851|7.161|0.887|2.486|0.922|0.790|0.954|0.117|0.973|0.018|

Result output description

The first three lines of the results file show which matrix library file,
which sequence file and which profile file have been used for this search.
Following this is a list of matches found in the searched sequence.

The first column gives the TRANSFAC(r) identifier of the matching matrix,
then comes the position and the strand where the respective match has been
found. The core similarity score is given in column three, the matrix
similarity score in column four. The last column gives the matching
sequence.

If the input sequence file contains several sequences, such a listing of
matches will be given for each sequence in the input file. Each listing
starts with the respective sequence identifier.

The last three lines of the file give the total length of all sequences
which have been searched, the total number of sites that have been found
and the frequency of sites per nucleotide.

Note: In contrast to the Match(TM) online version, the raw result on
command line gives the matches by matrix not by location.

For additional results and graphical outputs, please see the online
Match(TM) tool and the Match(TM) functionality and related tools in the 
ExPlain(TM) Analysis System.
