Tissue-specific profiles provided by Match(TM):

We provide with Match(TM) a number of tissue-specific profiles and a cell
cycle-specific profile. Groups of transcription factors known to be active
in a particular tissue have been collected for each profile from
TRANSFAC(r). The matrices linked to these transcription factors in TRANSFAC(r)
were then used to build a profile. The cut-offs used in the tissue
specific profiles are those that minimize false negative matches.


We provide the following tissue-/process-specific profiles:

* immune cell-specific profile
  This profile is designed to search for potential binding sites within
  regulatory regions of genes whose transcription is induced upon immune
  response in T-cells, B-cells, mast cells, myeloid cells, natural killer
  cells, and macrophages.

* cell cycle-specific profile
  This profile is designed to search for potential binding sites within
  regulatory regions of genes whose expression is dependent on the stage
  of cell cycle.

* muscle-specific profile
  This profile is designed to search for potential binding sites within
  regulatory regions of muscle-specific genes.

* liver-specific profile
  This profile is designed to search for potential binding sites within
  regulatory regions of liver-enriched genes.

* pancreatic beta-cell-specific profile
  This profile is designed to search for potential binding sites within
  regulatory regions of pancreatic beta-cell-specific genes.

* adipocyte-specific profile
  This profile is designed to search for potential binding sites within
  regulatory regions of adipocyte-specific genes.

* pituitary-specific profile
  This profile is designed to search for potential binding sites within
  regulatory regions of pituitary-specific genes.

* nerve system-specific profile
  This profile is designed to search for potential binding sites within
  regulatory regions of nerve system-specific genes.

* lung-specific profile
  This profile is designed to search for potential binding sites within
  regulatory regions of lung-specific genes.

* redox-sensitive profile
  This profile is designed to search for potential binding sites within
  regulatory regions of genes whose expression is redox-sensitive.
