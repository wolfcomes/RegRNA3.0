Notes on miRanda-3.0 code
1. The seed region match when running miRanda in strict mode were extended to 2-8.
Also, changes were made to the scan.c that checks for seed matches.

2. Reported hits output the position of the target site on the miRNA (query) and mRNA(ref). The coordinates for
miRNA are in reference to the 3' end. For example:

  Forward:     Score: 176.000000  Q:3 to 22  R:4502 to 4530 Align Len (27) (70.37%) (74.07%)

   Ref:      5' taAGTTACAGTTTGCACAAGTTCATCTCA 3'

   Energy:  -23.830000 kCal/Mol

Scores for this hit:
>hsa-miR-143__c gi|34485724|ref|NM_033360.2|    176.00  -23.83  0.00    0.000000e+00    3 23    4502 4530       27      70.37%  74.07%

Note that "Q:3 to 22" means that the alignment actually end 3 nt from the miRNA 3'end.
This should be "Q:1 to 20" - correct either in miRanda code or in parsing. 

3. Results from (Genes&Dev, 2004:504-511) and (Nature Biotech, 2005,23,1440) suggests G:U wobbles
 in seed regions interferes with miRNA activity. In accordance, the match5p matrix was modified such that 
 G:U pairs are scored as mismatches.
 
4. Changed G:U wobble weights in match matrix (scmatrix.h) from 2 to 0. Reduce the influance of G:U wobble on the alignments 
5. miRanda does not report back a single max alignment but all alignments that pass the score threshold value.

6. Changed match weights of A:U to 4 and kept G:C as 5. 
7. Energy cutoff makes a difference. Lower energy cutoff to -18 or -16
8. Run miranda mouse predictions with the following flags "-go -4.0 -ge -9.0 -en -16.0 -strict"
 using Pablo miRNA sequences.

9. The reported percent identity and percent similarity are related to the aligned region and not the entire length of the seq
 From example:
   Forward:     Score: 154.000000  Q:2 to 13  R:1 to 13 Align Len (11) (90.91%) (100.00%)

10. Beyond the strict matching, targets that have near perfect alignments with one mismatch or G:U in the seed region but very
 high %identity throughout the miRNA sequence should also be considered.
