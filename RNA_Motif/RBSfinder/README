The program "rbs_finder.pl" implements an algorithm to find ribosome binding 
sites(RBS) in the upstream regions of the genes annotated by Glimmer2, 
GeneMark, or other prokaryotic gene finders.
If there is no RBS-like patterns in this region, program searches for a
start codon having a RBS-like pattern ,in the same reading frame upstream
or downstream and relocates start codon accordingly. 

USAGE:
------
	rbs_finder.pl <Seq_file> <Whole_Coord_File> <Output_file> <RBS_window_size> [<Consensus_seq>] [-p <Partial_Coord_File>]
	
	where:
	
	<Seq_file>: Whole genome sequence in FASTA format.
	

	<Whole_Coord_file>: *All* the coordinates found by Glimmer2. This file should be in following format:

    <Gene id> <Start Codon Coord> <Stop Codon Coord>	
    1     	1030     		1140         
    2     	1214     		3010  	     
  		:
		:
		:

	There may be more than three columns , but the program will discard the other columns.

	<Output_file>: The name of the output file (see Output Format)

	<RBS_window_size>: This parameter determines how far the program should look for 
RBS-like pattern  in the upstream region of each of the genes. The best results obtained 
using a window size of 50bps.
	
	<Consensus_seq>:(optional): The default consensus sequence is ("aggag"). However a 
computed sequence can be used to get better results. The method to compute the consensus 
sequence is as follows:
		-Take the complement of last 30bps of 16S rRNA
		-Find the most abundantly found 5bps subsequence of this complement in the 
30bps upstream regions of the start codons annotated by Glimmer2.
		-Use this sequence as consensus sequence.  	 

	<Partial_Coord_File>:(optional) The coordinates that user wants to relocate or check for RBS site, which can be 
a subset of coordinates annotated by Glimmer2.This file should be in following format:
    
    <Gene id> <Start Codon Coord> <Stop Codon Coord>	
    1     	1030     		1140         
    2     	1214     		3010  	   
  		:

	There may be more than three columns , but the program will  discard the other columns.	


OUTPUT FORMAT:
--------------
	The program outputs a summary to standart output like:
	
	Summary:
	# of orfs that have RBS before original start codon loc= 880 -> 95.55%
	# of orfs that have RBS before new start codon loc= 23 -> 2.50%
	# of orfs that have no RBS= 18 ->  1.95%
	Total # of orfs: 921
		

	Program also outputs to the file given as argument in the following format:

		 NewStart     Stop	 	RBS			                  OldStart
  GeneID         Position     Position    Pattern Position     NewStartCodon    Shift   Codon Position

  ORF00006        129873      129217         ---        0          ATG             0     ATG   129873
  ORF00007        128756      129205       TAGGA   128743          ATG             0     ATG   128756

	The GeneID's are same as the original gene id's in the input. 
	RBS pattern is the RBS-like pattern found upstream of the start codon and RBS 
position if the start coordinate of this pattern.
	Shift is the amount of relocation done in order to find a start codon with a 
RBS-like pattern. Shift can be :
	- 0 if the original start codon has a RBS-like pattern in the window preceding it 
	- Negative if the original start coordinate moved upstream in the same reading frame
	- Positive if the original start coordinate moved downstream in the same reading frame
