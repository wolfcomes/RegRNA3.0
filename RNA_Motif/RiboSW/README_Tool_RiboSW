This is the user guide to teach user how to use Riboswitch Searcher.

[Compile Main Program]

    g++ -O3 -lpcrecpp search_General.cpp

[Run Main Program]

    ./drive_search.pl -a [fasta_File] [descr_file] > [fasta_file].myResult
    
    (descr_file = Descriptor file, ex: RS.Purine.descr)

[Extract result]

    ./HMM_proc.pl [fasta_file] [hmm_model_file] [e-value]
    
    (This utility need 3 arguments, fasta file, hmm model file and e-value as input)


    ./rbprune.pl [fasta_file].E10.hmmResult

    (In this instance, we get e-value 10 in HMMER result file)


====
In descriptors every fileds describes below:

[TYPE];[Descriptor of Stem]'[Report section]'[Sequence information section]%
      _                    _                _                              _
        separator            separator        separator                      end mark

**TYPE:
    4 types of sub-structure to compose the RNA structure

**Descriptor of stem:
 swL, swU, sw, sp,     stemLower, stemUpper, loop Lower, loop Upper, bulge, push num,  [wts_m, _M, wte_m, _M]'

 swL/swU:   Slide window lower and upper bound
 sw:        Size increasing of slide window
 sp:        Start point (used in stem 1), to describe increasing of starting search point in the whole RNA query sequence
 stemLower/stemUpper:
            The lower/upper bound of this stem structure
 loop Lower/Upper:
            The lower/upper bound of the loop region
 bulge:     Bulge permit in this stem structure
 push_num:  Push the next stem start point into stack (push num=0 if it is the last stem)
            Push num=1, if next stem is not a branch loop
            Push num=2, if next stem is a branch loop (push start point of "branch loop" and "the stem outer of the branch loop"

 [parameter below can be ignored]
 wts:       Where to start, means the interval between this stem and the previous one, can be ignore
 wte:       Where to end, means the interval between this stem and the next one, can be ignore
 [wts_m: wts minimal, wts_M: wts Maximal, wte_m: wte minimal, wte_M: wte Maximal]

   |<-outer->|stem|<--loop-->|stem|<-outer->|
   ..........xxxxxx..........xxxxxx..........
   |<------------ slide window ------------>|

**Report section & Sequence information section:

 Use "Regular expression" of PCRE to describe.

 o+: outer of 5'-end
 o-: outer of 3'-end
    o+0 or o-0 mean whole sequence of 5'-end outer or 3'-end outer
 h+: helix of 5'-end
 h-: helix of 3'-end
 h=0: full helix sequence
 l+: loop sequence of 5'-end
 l-: loop sequence of 3'-end
 l=0: full loop sequence


   3'-end                          ___
         \ 'h+'-->        <---'h-'/   \
          -yyyyyyXXXXXXXXXXzzzzzz/     | loop sequence
          -yyyyyyXXXXXXXXXXzzzzzz\     |
