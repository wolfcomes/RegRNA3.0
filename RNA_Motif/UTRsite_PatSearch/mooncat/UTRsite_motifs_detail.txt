Description:     Metazoan histone 3'-UTR mRNAs, lacking a polyA tail, 
                 contain a highly conserved stem-loop structure with a 
                 six base stem and a four base loop. This stem-loop 
                 structure plays a different role in the nucleus and in 
                 the cytoplasm. In the nucleus, it is involved in pre-mRNA 
                 processing and nucleocytoplasmic transport, whereas in the 
                 cytoplasm it enhances translation efficiency and regulates 
                 histone mRNA stability. The trans-acting factor which 
                 interacts with the 3'-UTR hairpin structure of histone 
                 mRNAs is a 31 kDa stem-loop binding protein in mammals 
                 (SLBP) present both in nuclei and polyribosomes.
                 In mammals in addition to SLBP histone mRNA processing requires 
                 at least one additional factor: the U7 snRNP, which binds 
                 a purine-rich element 10-20 nt downstream of the stem-loop 
                 sequence (Histone Downstream Element, HDE).
                 The consensus stem-loop structure is shown below:
                 
                        H U
                      H     H
                        U-A

                        Y-R
                        Y-R
                        G-C
                        G-C
                    CCAAA  ACCCA 
                 
                 In all histone mRNAs analyzed so far  no G has been 
                 observed in the four base loop. In all metazoan except 
                 C. elegans , there are two invariant urydines in the first 
                 and third base of the loop.
                 In C.elegans the first base of the loop is C. Either 5' and 3' 
                 flanking sequences are necessary for high affinity binding 
                 of SLBP. The 5' flanking sequence consensus is CCAAA and 
                 the 3' flanking sequence consensus is ACCCA or ACCA with
                 cleavage occuring after the A. 
                 The histone 3'-UTR hairpin structure is peculiar in that 
                 the bases of the stem are conserved unlike most functional 
                 hairpin motifs where conserved bases are found in single 
                 stranded loop regions only. The sequence of the stem and 
                 flanking sequences are critical for binding of the SLBP.

Taxon_Range:     UTR, 5' and 3' UTRs
Description:     The "iron-responsive element" (IRE) is a particular 
                 hairpin structure located in the 5'-untranslated region 
                 (5'-UTR) or in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of 
                 various mRNAs coding for proteins involved in cellular 
                 iron metabolism. The IREs are recognized by trans-acting 
                 proteins known as Iron Regulatory Proteins (IRPs) that 
                 control mRNA translation rate and stability. Two closely 
                 related IRPs, denoted as IRP-1 and IRP-2, have been 
                 identified so far which bind IREs and become inactivated 
                 (IRP-1) or degradated (IRP-2) when the iron level in the 
                 cell increases. IRPs show a significant degree of similarity 
                 to mitochondrial aconitase (EC 4.2.1.3). It has been shown 
                 that under high iron conditions IRP-1, which contains a 
                 4Fe-4S cluster that possibly acts as a cellular iron 
                 biosensor, has enzymatic activity and may act as a 
                 cytosolic aconitase. Cellular iron homeostasis in 
                 mammalian cells is maintained by the coordinate 
                 regulation of the expression of "Transferrin receptor", 
                 which determines the amount of iron acquired by the cell, 
                 and of "Ferritin", an iron storage protein, which determines 
                 the degree of intracellular iron sequestration. Thus if 
                 the cell requires more iron, the level of transferrin 
                 receptor has to increase and conversely the level of 
                 ferritin has to decrease. Ferritin, in vertebrates, 
                 consists of 24 protein subunits of two types, type H 
                 with Mr of 21 kDa and type L with Mr of 19-20 kDa. 
                 The apoprotein (Mr 450 kDa) is able to store up to 4500 
                 Fe (III) atoms. The 5'-UTR of H- and L ferritin mRNAs 
                 contain one IRE whereas multiple IREs are located 
                 in the 3'-UTR of transferrin receptor mRNA.
                 In the case of low iron concentration, IRPs are able to 
                 bind the IREs in the 5'-UTR of H- and L-Ferritin mRNAs 
                 repressing their translation and the IREs in the 3'-UTR 
                 of transferrin mRNA increasing its stability. Conversely, 
                 if iron concentration is high, IRP binding is diminished, 
                 which increases translation of ferritins and downregulate 
                 expression of the transferrin receptor.
                 IREs have also been found in the mRNAs of other proteins 
                 involved in iron metabolism like "erythroid 
                 5-aminolevulinic-acid synthase (eALAS) " involved in 
                 heme biosynthesis, the mRNA encoding the mitochondrial 
                 aconitase (a citric acid cycle enzyme) and the mRNA 
                 encoding the iron-sulfur subunit of succinate dehydrogenase 
                 (another citric acid cycle enzyme)  in Drosophila melanogaster.
                 Two alternative IRE consensus have been found. In certain 
                 IREs the bulge is best drawn with a single unpaired cytosine, 
                 whereas in others the cytosine nucleotide and two additional 
                 bases seem to oppose one free 3' nucleotide. Some evidences 
                 also suggest a structured loop with an interaction between 
                 nucleotide one and nucleotide five (in boldcase).

                 type 1 with short apical loop; and type 2 with large apical loops carrying 
                 intra-loop base pairings.

Description:     Increased levels of Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) 
                 expression are found in patients with Alzheimer's disease. 
                 APP mRNA stability is controlled by a 29-nt element in 
                 the 3-UTR of APP mRNA which has been found to interact 
                 with multiple cytosolic proteins.
                 In resting cells, where no protein binding activity
                 is detected, the 29-nt region acts in cis to destabilise
                 APP mRNA (t1/2=4h). 
                 In mitogen activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells or 
                 cycling tumour cells the binding activity dramatically
                 increases leading to APP stabilisation (t1/2>10h). 
                 The 29-nt element is highly conserved in mammals 
                 (see the alignment below) both in primary sequence and 
                 position about (200 nt from the stop codon).

Name:            Cytoplasmic polyadenylation element (CPE)
Pattern:         uuuuuwau 1...200 aauaaa 1...100 $
Taxon_Range:     3UTR, 3'UTRs
Description:     Cytoplasmic polyadenylation is an evolutionarily 
                 conserved mechanism regulating translational activation 
                 of a set of quiescent maternal messenger RNAs (mRNAs)
                 during early development.  Cytoplasmic poly(A) elongation
                 occurs in a wide range of species, ranging from clam to 
                 mouse.  The relevance of this process during late oogenesis 
                 and early embryogenesis has been shown by studies in the 
                 mouse, Xenopus, and Drosophila.
                 In mouse and Xenopus, the only vertebrates so far examined,
                 the critical regulatory sequences, referred to as 
                 Cytoplasmic Polyadenylation Elements (CPEs), are AU-rich 
                 and located in the 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR) near the
                 canonical nuclear polyadenylation element (AAUAAA), which 
                 also is required for proper poly(A) addition.
                 The CPE has the general structure of UUUUUUAU. 
                 However, the CPE is not identical in all mRNAs and its
                 position varies relative to AAUAAA (generally within 100 
                 nucleotides).  The minimal CPE capable to stimulate
                 elongation of a poly(A) tail appears to be UUUUAU, and 
                 recent experiments show also the existence of substantial 
                 context and position effects on CPE function.

Description:     In the nematode C. elegans sex determining gene tra-2 is 
                 involved in the specification of hermaphrodite rather that 
                 female development.
                 Negative regulation of tra-2 allow development of XX animals 
                 as hermaphrodite rather than female.
                 This regulation is in both germ line and soma and it is
                 necessary for normal male development.
                 A regulatory element in the tra-2 3'-UTR, consisting
                 in a 28 nt direct repeat, also termed DRE (Direct Repeat 
                 Element), has been found to be necessary for negative 
                 regulation of tra-2 allowing the onset of spermatogenesis.
                 Regulation is mediated at translational level, probably 
                 by a trans-acting protein factor called DRF (direct Repeat
                 Factor) with binding activity to DRE.
                 DRE consists in two copies of a 28 nt sequence separated by 
                 4 nt. It has been proposed that when no DRF is bound , 
                 translation is not inhibited. Binding of a single repeat 
                 cause partial regulation, and the binding to both repeats 
                 causes full inhibition.  No stable secondary structure 
                 was predicted for the DREs by computer analysis.
                 Elements functionally equivalent to DREs have been found in
                 the tra-2 gene of the nematode C. Briggsae and in the human
                 oncogene GLI.For this reason DRE has been renamed TGE 
                 (tra-2 and GLI elements). 
                 Possible mechanisms are that these regulatory elements 
                 may control the length of the poly-A tail, which in turn 
                 may influence translation. Alternatively, the TGEs may 
                 sequester mRNA away from the translation machinery or 
                 they can directly inhibit the interaction of initiation factors 
                 or of ribosomal subunits with the 5'-UTR.

Description:     The 3'UTR of drosophila nanos mRNA contains the 
                 essential signals for generating the nanos gradient 
                 emanating from the posterior pole of drosophila embryos.
                 The polarized distribution of nanos is generated by the 
                 localization dependent translation of nanos mRNA in the 
                 pole plasm. The translation control element (TCE) consist
                 of a 90-nt region located in the 3'UTR of nanos mRNA 
                 which is able to fold into a bipartite secondary structure that is
                 recognized by Smaug repressor and at least one additional factor.
                 A stem-loop bearing the CUGGC penramer in the loop is required for 
                 Smaug TCE unteractionn whereas both sequences and structure of 
                 another stem-loop is critical for TCE function.The translation 
                 activation is mediated by the interaction of localization 
                 factors with a 540-nt sequence regions overlapping the TCE 
                 structural motif.

Description:     Erythroid 15-lipoxygenase (15-LOX) synthesized in 
                 the early stages of erytropoiesis catalyses the 
                 degradation of lipids and is an important factor
                 responsible for the degradation of mitochondria 
                 during reticulocyte maturation. The 3'UTR of 15-LOX 
                 mRNA contains tandem repeat sequences, referred to as 
                 "DICE" for "DIfferentiation Control Element" which
                 specifically bind to regulatory proteins, formerly 
                 called LOX-BP. This binding specifically inhibits 15-LOX 
                 mRNA translation. In rabbit 15-LOX mRNA, there have been 
                 found 10 tandem copies of the repeat sequence, but only 4 
                 (3 tandem) in human. Experimentally, a functional
                 DICE consisting of two repeat elements has been described. 
                 The regulatory binding proteins have been identified as hnRNP 
                 K and hnRNP E1.

Description:     AU-rich elements (AREs) present in the 3'untranslated 
                 region of mature lymphokine and cytokine mRNAs regulate 
                 mRNA stability and translational efficiency. Based on 
                 their sequence features and functional properties AREs
                 can be divided into three classes. Class II AREs direct 
                 asynchronous cytoplasmic deadenylation (processive kinetics) 
                 generating poly-A(-) mRNAs. Among mRNA with class II ARE in 
                 their 3' UTR are GM-CSF, IL-2.The minimum number of AUUUA
                 tandem motifs to activate processive degradation is 4 
                 (of which at least 3 in tandem). 
                 Furthermore, an AU-rich region 20-30 nt long immediately 
                 5' to the cluster of AUUUA motifs can greatly enhance
                 the degradation activity.

Description:     All vertebrate ribosomal protein and translation 
                 elongation factors analyzed to date contain a 5' 
                 terminal oligopyrimidine tract consisting of 
                 5-15 pyrimidines  (Kato et al., 1994)  that is 
                 required for coordinate translational repression  
                 (Levy et al., 1991; Kaspar et al., 1992)  during 
                 growth arrest, differentiation, development and 
                 certain drug treatments (reviewed in  Kaspar et al., 
                 1993; Meyuhas et al., 1996 ).  This motif begins with 
                 a C and is followed by a G residue (consensus sequence 
                 C(Py)nG where n=3-14 pyrimidines); otherwise, no other 
                 requirements appear to be necessary except for consecutive 
                 pyrimidines.  Deletion of the pyrimidine tract or 
                 exchanging purines for pyrimidines results in unregulated 
                 translation  (Levy et al., 1991; Kaspar et al., 1992) . 
                 A protein of ~56 kDa was found which binds to the leaders 
                 of ribosomal proteins L32 and L1 but not to similar mutant 
                 RNAs lacking an intact polypyrimidine tract required for 
                 translational repression  (Kaspar et al., 1992; Cardinali et 
                 al., 1993) .  Recent results in a Xenopus system suggest 
                 that the La autoantigen may bind to the polypyrimidine 
                 motif and be involved in translational regulation  
                 (Pellizzoni et al., 1996).

Taxon_Range:     UTR, 5' and 3' UTRs
Description:     The 5' and 3' untranslated (UTR) regions of the Na+
                 independent glucose transporter GLUT1 mRNA are highly 
                 conserved among species being embedded of several 
                 cis-acting regulatory elements which either stabilize 
                 or destabilize the mRNA subsequent to the binding of
                 specific cytosolic or polysome proteins in response to glucose
                 deprivation or to brain derived trophic factors.
                 A  10 nucleotide cis-acting element, located in the 
                 GLUT1 3'-UTR region, has been shown to increase GLUT1 
                 gene expression via specific binding to a 80 kDa protein, 
                 expressed in human brain hemangioblastoma and in the C6
                 rat brain glioma, which mediates mRNA stabilization.

Taxon_Range:     UTR, 5' and 3' UTRs
Description:     Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) is a key cytokine 
                 regulator of the immune process and of the tissue homeostasis.
                 The production of TNF-alpha is mainly controlled 
                 post-trascriptionally by cis-elements located in the
                 3'-UTR and which regulate mRNA stability and translation 
                 efficency.  In addition to a class II AU-rich element 
                 (ARE2) previously found in the 3'-UTR of TNF-alpha mRNA, 
                 another RNA binding motif has been characterized
                 about 150 nt downstream. This element contains a consensus
                 core of AUAUUUA, which is highly conserved in evolution, 
                 and has been suggested to synergize with the ARE2 element 
                 in the repression of TNF-alpha mRNA translation and in the
                 regulation of translation.

Taxon_Range:     UTR, 5' and 3' UTRs
Description:     Vimentin is an intermediate filement protein whose 3'UTR 
                 sequence is highly conserved among vertebrates and has been 
                 found to be a target for one or more RNA binding protein 
                 which include a 46-and 35-kDa protein plus a minor band 
                 containing a 60-kDa protein. The sequences required for       
                 binding are contained within a region 61-114 nucleotides 
                 downstream the stop codon which is able to fold into a Y-shaped 
                 secondary structure confirmed by nuclease and lead cleavage.
                 It has been suggested that this 53 nt conserved region located
                 in the 3'UTR and associated protein(s) might be important for 
                 vimentin mRNA function as well as for its localization in the 
                 perinuclear region of the cytoplasm possibly at sites of
                 intermediate filament assembly.

Description:     Internal mRNA ribosome binding is a mechanism of 
                 translation initiation alternative to the 
                 conventional 5'-cap dependendent ribosome scanning 
                 mechanism.
                 The internal initiation mechanism, first observed 
                 in picornavirus, is also found in some cellular mRNAs, 
                 such as human immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein 
                 (BiP) mRNA, Antennapedia mRNA of drosophila and FGF-2 mRNA.
                 This mechanism may be advantageous for specific translation 
                 of mRNAs during cell cycle when underphosphorilated eIF-4F 
                 prevents conventional translation initiation. The internal 
                 initiation mechanism is dependent on a cis-acting element, 
                 defined as internal ribosome entry site (IRES), located
                 in the 5'UTR region of the mRNA.
                 Comparative analysis of known IRES in some cellular mRNAs 
                 identified a common structural motif forming a Y-type stem-loop 
                 structure followed by the AUG triplet or followed by additional 
                 stem-loop structures and the AUG triplet.

Description:     Translational repression of msl-2 (male specific lethal) 
                 mRNA, which controls dosage compensation in Drosophila, 
                 is mediated by the female-specific RNA binding protein 
                 Sex-lethal (SXL).
                 SXL binding to two sites, consisting respectively of U11 
                 and U16 located in the 5'UTR of the msl-2 mRNA, serves a 
                 dual function in inhibiting msl-2 expression in female 
                 flies: It enforces retention of a 5' UTR intron
                 [splicing inhibition in the nucleus] and subsequently 
                 blocks translation in the cytoplasm.
                 It has been observed that the cytoplasmic translational 
                 repression requires four additional SXL-binding sites 
                 (U7-U9) clustered in the 3'UTR.
                 Experiments using a cell-free translation system from 
                 Drosophila embryos which recapitulates critical features 
                 of mRNA translation in eukaryotes such as cap and poly-A 
                 dependence, have shown that tight regulation of
                 msl-2 translation requires cooperation between the 
                 SXL-binding sites in both the 5' and 3'UTRs but is not 
                 affected by poly-A tail as in numerous other 
                 developmentally regulated mRNAs.

Description:     The posterior localization of oskar protein in the posterior

                 deployment of nanos, the posterior body patterning morphogen

                 repression of oskar mRNA prior to its localization at the 
                 posterior pole of the oocyte. Translation repression is
                 mediated by the ovarian protein bruno that binds specifically
                 to a cis-acting element located in the the 3UTR of the 
                 oskar mRNA made by a tandem repetition of a 10 nt long

Description:     A highly conserved eight base sequence within the 3'

                 (Adh) mRNA, identified by phylogenetic analysis, was found

                 mutagenesis followed by P element mediated germline 
                 transformation. Downregulation was found to be the result
                 of a temporally and spatially generated decrease in the Adh 
                 transcript possibly resulting by either a reduction of 
                 transcription rate or most likely by a reduction of the mRNA 
                 stability.

Description:     Efficient translation of Barley yellow dwarf 
                 virus (BYDV) RNA, lacking both a 5'cap and a poly(A) 
                 tail, is mediated by a cap-independent translation
                 element (TE) located in the 3'UTR whose minimum length 
                 is obout 90 nt. Nuclease probing and structure directed 
                 mutagenesis has shown that TE is able to fold into a specific 
                 cruciform secondary structure containing four helices. 
                 Cap-independent translation requires all secondary structure
                 elements and most primary sequences.
                 Recent data suggest that TE base pairs to the 5'UTR unless 
                 the TE itself is located in the 5'UTR. Similar structures 
                 appear to be present in soybean dwarf luteovirus (SDV), 
                 and tobacco necrosis necrovirus (TNE). The TNV TE
                 lacks a stem-loop present the BYDV TE.  All have conserved 
                 loops that can base-pair to a stem-loop in the 5' UTR. 
                 TE mediates translation initiation at the AUG closest to 
                 the mRNA 5' end, possibly facilitating ribosome recruiting 
                 and 3'-5' communication.

Description:     The 3'UTR of three proneural genes (achaete, lethal of scute, 
                 and atonal) encoding basic Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) 
                 transcriptional activators that initiate neurogenesis in 
                 Drosophila contain a conserved 13 nt long element, AAUGGAAGACAAU, 
                 denoted as the proneural box (PB). The central 7 nt of the PB are 
                 exactly complementary to the GY-box (GYB) present in the 3'UTR of 
                 many Notch pathway target genes in Drosophila.
                 The predicted duplex interaction, generally more extended than 
                 the 7-mer core PB:GYB, might serve to regulate neurogenesis.

Description:     Many Notch pathway target genes in Drosophila, including most 
                 members of the basic helix-loop-helix repressor family and the
                 Bearded family, contain a series of conserved sequence motifs in

                 The K box (cTGTGATa) is present in one or more copies in many of 
                 these 3'UTRs and mediates negative post-transcriptional regulation, 
                 mainly effected by decreased transcript levels.  Regulation by the 
                 K box is spatially and temporally ubiquitous, and likely involves 
                 the formation of RNA-RNA duplexes with complementary sequences found 
                 at the 5'end of many micro RNAs (miRNAs).  K box-complementary miRNAs 
                 are found in other metazoa, suggestive of functional conservation.

Description:     The androgen receptor mRNA contains a highly conserved UC-rich 
                 region in the 3'-untranslated region that are the target of HuR 
                 and CP1/CP2 RNA binding proteins imvolved in the regulation of 
                 mRNA stability and translation initiation. Mutational analysis 
                 has shown that HuR (also binding AU-rich motifs) binds to the U-rich 
                 portion of the UC-rich region whereas CP1 and CP2 bind to the C-rich 
                 portion. A model of cooperative binding of HuR and CPs is proposed 
                 with binding disruption resulting in transcript destabilization.

Description:     Developmental regulation of elastin synthesis occurs through modulation 
                 of the stability of its mRNA. It has been demonstrated that the binding 
                 of cytosolic proteins to a large region of the 3'UTR of elastin mRNA, 
                 possibly folded into a stable secondary structure, is associated to 
                 stabilization/destabilization of elastin mRNA. Using deletion and 
                 competition analyses the core cis-acting sequence has been mapped to 
                 a 20 nt long purine rich sequence containing at least a 3-fold repeat 
                 of GGGA (G3A) motif conserved from human to chicken.

Description:     Stabilization of insulin mRNA in response to glucose is a key 
                 modulator of insulin production. Experimental data suggest that 
                 insulin mRNA stability  is controlled by the binding of a 55-60 kDa 
                 protein to a pyrimidine-rich sequence (PRS) located in the 3UTR 
                 of insulin mRNA. The binding of this protein, probably the polypirimidine 
                 tract-binding protein (PTB), is stimulated by reducing agents (e.g. DTT) 
                 and glucose. Mutation of the core PSR sequence, present in human and 
                 rodent but not all mammal insulin mRNAs, prevents protein binding and 
                 results in transcripts destabilization.

Description:     The localization of beta-actin mRNA to the cell periphery is modulated 
                 by an AC-rich "zipcode" element, 54 nt long, located in the mRNA 3'UTR, 
                 proximal to the stop codon.
                 This element is highly conserved in all vertebrate beta-actin mRNAs.
                 The polarized distribution of beta-actin mRNA, which implies the asymmetric 
                 distribution of its protein product, involves a complex of trans-acting 
                 protein factors binding both to the zipcode, such as the 68 kDa ZBP-1 
                 RNA binding protein, and to the actin network.

Description:     Alpha subunit of calcium calmodulin dependent kinase II (CaMKII) 
                 protein, highly enriched at synapse is important in synaptic plasticity, learning and long-term memory. The 5 part (nt 1-94) of  3UTR of CaMKII 
                 mRNA mediates its dendritic targeting.
                 An inhibitory element located downstream in the 3UTR prevents CaMKII 
                 mRNA transport into dendrites. 
                 Prolonged depolarization override transport repression thus suggesting an 
                 anctivity-sensitive interaction between the two control elements. 
                 A similar dendritic localization element has been found to be active in 
                 the 3UTR of neurogranin (Ng) mRNA, coding for a neuronal specific calmodulin 
                 binding protein. The minimal targeting signal denoted as CaMKII/Ng dendritic

Taxon_Range:     5UTR, 5'UTRs
Description:     The control of translation is a fundamental mechanism in the regulation of gene expression. 
                 Among the cis-elements that play a role in translation regulation are upstream open reading frames (uORFs) 
                 located in the 5UTR of mRNA. UORFs can induce the formation of translational competent ribosomes that may translate the uORF 
                 and (i) terminate and reinitiate, (ii) terminate and leave the mRNA, generally resulting in down-regulation of the main open reading frame. 
                 In some cases the uORF may enhance translation in specific conditions and the uORF encoded peptide may or may not play a regulatory activity.

Description:     The long half-life of alpha-globin mRNA (>24h in the developing erythroid cells) is mediated by three cytosine-rich regions, possibly folded into a conserved secondary structure, located in its 3'UTR.
                 These C-rich regions, also found in other stable mRNAs, such as alpha(I) collagen, tyrosine hydrosylase and 15-lipoxygenase mRNAs, assemble an RNA -protein complex (alpha-complex). Mutations of any of these C-rich elements block alpha-complex formation and remarkably decrease alpha-globin mRNA stability.
                 Major components of the&#61472; alpha-complex are two proteins called&#61472;alphaCP1 and alphaCP2 (alpha-globin poly(C)-binding proteins) also known as hnRNPE or PCBP, containing three KH domains known to mediate binding to mRNA.
                 Experimental studies suggest that the alpha complex stabilizes&#61472;alpha-globin mRNA by two mechanisms; inhibition of a deadenylation-dependent 3'exonuclease or protection from endonucleolitic cleavage pathway.

Description:     Delayed translational silencing of ceruloplasmin (Cp) mRNA by gamma-interferon (IFN-gamma) is directed by a structural element in its 3' untranslated region.
                 Translational silencing requires the binding of a cytosolic inhibitor to the Cp 3'UTR and all essential elements of mRNA circularization, i.e. eukaryotic initiation factor 4G, poly-A binding protein and poly-A tail.
                 The 29-nt structural element, denoted as IFN-gamma-activated inhibitor of translation (GAIT), consisting of a 5-nt terminal loop, a weak 3-bp helix, an asymmetric internal bulge and a proximal 6-bp helix, has been experimentally demonstrated to be sufficient for translational silencing both in vitro and in vivo in human. A similar element can be found in sheep but not in rodents.

                 VRT, UTRs from vertebrate (not mammal) mRNAs
Description:     During progesterone-stimulated Xenopus oocyte maturation, early cytoplasmic polyadenylation 
                 and translational activation of the Mos mRNA is mediated by a 24 nt region located at the 3'-end of Mos 3' UTR, 
                 termed a polyadenylation response element (PRE).  
                 The Mos PRE partially overlaps a downstream cytoplasmic polyadenylation element (CPE).  
                 The PRE appears to be conserved in other maternal Xenopus mRNAs, is responsive to the MAP kinase signaling pathway 
                 and is functionally distinct from the late-acting, cdc-2 responsive, cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements (CPEs).

Description:     In the early embryo of drosophila several transcripts localize exclusively apically of the peripheral nuclei. 
                 Apical transport of hairy pair-rule mRNA is mediated by a 121 nt element located in the 3 untranslated region. 
                 This element comprises two stem-loop structures in which double-stranded stems have been observed to be essential 
                 for localization. Base pair identities within the stem are not essential but contribute to the efficiency of localization 
                 thus suggesting that specificity is mediated by higher-order structure.

                 Oligodendrocyte transport occurs via mRNA packaging into granules in the nucleus followed by export to cytoplasm and then microtubule- or 
                 microfilament-mediated transport to the final destination.

                 VRT, UTRs from vertebrate (not mammal) mRNAs
Description:     Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is secreted in response to the inflammatory mediators IL-1 and TNF-alpha 
                 and by activated macrophages. The synthesis of G-CSF is regulated at the post-transcriptional level through the control of mRNA stability. 
                 In unstimulated cells G-CSF mRNA is unstable but becomes stabilized in response to IL-1 or TNF-alpha, and also in the case 
                 of monocytes and macrophages, in response to LPS.
                 G-CSF mRNA contains two types of cis-acting destabilizing elements. In addition to several copies of the AU-rich element (ARE) 
                 it contains another destabilizing element whose activity resides in a stem-loop structure, whose consensus sequence has been 
                 determined by site-directed mutagenesis. The stem is 8 nt long (or 7 nt in chicken) with a conserved YAU loop.
                 The destabilizing activity consists in the enhancing of deadenylation rate.

                 VRT, UTRs from vertebrate (not mammal) mRNAs
Description:     Renin is a highly specific endopeptidase, whose only known function is to generate angiotensin I from angiotensinogen in the plasma, 
                 inducing the production of angiotensin II and initiating a cascade of reactions that results in an elevation of blood pressure 
                 and increased sodium retention by the kidney.
                 Renin (REN) mRNA stability is modulated by a cis-acting element, about 35 nt long, located in the 3UTR. This element, that contributes 
                 to basal REN mRNA instability, is the target of a number of mRNA binding proteins that destabilize (HADHB) 
                 or stabilize (HuR, CP1) REN mRNA regulating rennin production.
